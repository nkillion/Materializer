============

A game written in JMonkey Engine 3 (Java) in which the player draws shapes that are created as 3d objects in-game, and uses these objects to progress through levels.

Instructions for play:
  Press 'g' to bring up the drawing screen.
    Click points on the screen, one at a time, and be sure the shape is polygonal and does not cross over itself.
    Once you've drawn as many points as you want, click the lightning bolt (The middle button on the drawing screen).
  You can now left click to generate the shape you drew, in 3D.
  
  Other controls:
    w,a,s,d to walk around. Space to jump.
    Press 'q' while looking at a mesh you created to pick it up, and 'q' again to drop it.
    While holding an object, press the numpad arrows (2, 4, 6, 8 on numpad) to rotate it.
